This document defines Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), a new type of identifier that enables verifiable,
decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject
 (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject. Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or services, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller to prove control of the DID. Please read our Press Release to learn more about this tool to empower everyone on the web with privacy-respecting online identity and consent-based data sharing.
